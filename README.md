# MazeGenerator
A simple maze generator plugin for PocketMine-MP.

### Usage
```
> /mazegen <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>
Generates a maze between the points.
```
The maze will be generated using the block you have in your hand. If there is no block in your hand, stone will be used instead.

### Tests
Here's a `/mazegen ~ ~ ~ ~+250 ~+2 ~+250`. The maze generator doesn't ship with the glowstone base, only the stone walls and air spaces between the stone walls!
